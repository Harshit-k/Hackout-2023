# Hackout-2023
This is a hackathon project for the Hackout hackathon 2023

Our idea is to create a health ID for people so that they can quickly register in hospitals without filling any forms or waiting in line. In case of emergency situations, all of your medical data and emergency contacts will be easily accessible to the hospital so that they can take quick action (using your medical data as basis for diagnosis).

On this website you can make a profile and save it. We will generate a QR code & a URL which when opened will lead doctors to your profile.
